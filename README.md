# Stock Analysis with VBA
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze two sets of stock data to determine their volumes, return rates, and highlight those with positive return rates. I was given the data for 12 different stocks from the years of 2017 and 2018. I initially created a successful project that executed the analysis but was challenged to speed up the results by refactoring (editing) my VBA code. 
## Results
After refactoring the original code we found a significant change in the speed of the output as seen below:

## Summary
By refactoring the code it's easier to read, takes up less memory, and makes executes more effecientyly and faster. However, as the saying goes "If it ain't broke don't fix it!" Refactoring code could potenitally lead to execution issues if you're not careful. 

In my case I definitely ran into some issues that had to be resolved while refactoring the code, but in the end it proved to be successful and speed up the output of the results.
