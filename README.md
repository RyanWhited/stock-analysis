# Stock Analysis 
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze 2 sets of stock data which included 12 different stocks to determine their volumes and return rates for both 2017 and 2018. I initially created a successful project that executed the analysis but was challenged to speed up the results by refactoring (editing) my VBA code. 
## Results
After refactoring the original code we found a significant change in the speed of the output as seen below:
- 2017

- 2018
